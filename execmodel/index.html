<h1>Execution Model</h1>

<p>
A basic unit of parallel computation in Charm++ programs is a chare. A chare
is similar to a process, an actor, an ADA task, etc. At its most basic level,
it is just a C++ object. A Charm++ computation consists of a large number of
chares distributed on available processors of the system, and interacting with
each other via asynchronous method invocations. Asynchronously invoking a
method on a remote object can also be thought of as sending a “message” to it.
So, these method invocations are sometimes referred to as messages. (besides,
in the implementation, the method invocations are packaged as messages
anyway). Chares can be created dynamically.
</p>
<p>
Conceptually, the system maintains a “work-pool” consisting of seeds for new
chares, and messages for existing chares. The Charm++ runtime system ( Charm
RTS) may pick multiple items, non-deterministically, from this pool and
execute them, with the proviso that two different methods cannot be
simultaneously executing on the same chare object (say, on different
processors). Although one can define a reasonable theoretical operational
semantics of Charm++ in this fashion, a more practical description of
execution is useful to understand Charm++. A Charm++ application’s execution
is distributed among Processing Elements (PEs), which are OS threads or
processes depending on the selected Charm++ build options. On each PE, there
is a scheduler operating with its own private pool of messages. Each
instantiated chare has one PE which is where it currently resides. The pool on
each PE includes messages meant for Chares residing on that PE, and seeds for
new Chares that are tentatively meant to be instantiated on that PE. The
scheduler picks a message, creates a new chare if the message is a seed (i.e.
a constructor invocation) for a new Chare, and invokes the method specified by
the message. When the method returns control back to the scheduler, it repeats
the cycle. I.e. there is no pre-emptive scheduling of other invocations.
</p>
<p>
When a chare method executes, it may create method invocations for other
chares. The Charm Runtime System (RTS, sometimes referred to as the Chare
Kernel in the manual) locates the PE where the targeted chare resides, and
delivers the invocation to the scheduler on that PE.
</p>
<p>
Methods of a chare that can be remotely invoked are called entry methods.
Entry methods may take serializable parameters, or a pointer to a message
object. Since chares can be created on remote processors, obviously some
constructor of a chare needs to be an entry method. Ordinary entry methods [1]
are completely non-preemptive- Charm++ will not interrupt an executing method
to start any other work, and all calls made are asynchronous.
</p>
<p>
Charm++ provides dynamic seed-based load balancing. Thus location (processor
number) need not be specified while creating a remote chare. The Charm RTS
will then place the remote chare on a suitable processor. Thus one can imagine
chare creation as generating only a seed for the new chare, which may take
root on some specific processor at a later time.
</p>
<p>
Chares can be grouped into collections. The types of collections of chares
supported in Charm++ are: chare-arrays, chare-groups, and chare-nodegroups,
referred to as arrays, groups, and nodegroups throughout this manual for
brevity. A Chare-array is a collection of an arbitrary number of migratable
chares, indexed by some index type, and mapped to processors according to a
user-defined map group. A group (nodegroup) is a collection of chares, with
exactly one member element on each PE (“node”).
</p>
<p>
Charm++ does not allow global variables, except readonly variables. A chare
can normally only access its own data directly. However, each chare is
accessible by a globally valid name. So, one can think of Charm++ as
supporting a global object space.
</p>
<p>
Every Charm++ program must have at least one mainchare. Each mainchare is
created by the system on processor 0 when the Charm++ program starts up.
Execution of a Charm++ program begins with the Charm Kernel constructing all
the designated mainchares. For a mainchare named X, execution starts at
constructor X() or X(CkArgMsg *) which are equivalent. Typically, the
mainchare constructor starts the computation by creating arrays, other chares,
and groups. It can also be used to initialize shared readonly objects.
</p>
<p>
Charm++ program execution is terminated by the CkExit call. Like the exit
system call, CkExit never returns, and it optionally accepts an integer value
to specify the exit code that is returned to the calling shell. If no exit
code is specified, a value of zero (indicating successful execution) is
returned. The Charm RTS ensures that no more messages are processed and no
entry methods are called after a CkExit. CkExit need not be called on all
processors; it is enough to call it from just one processor at the end of the
computation.
</p>
<p>
As described so far, the execution of individual Chares is “reactive”: When
method A is invoked the chare executes this code, and so on. But very often,
chares have specific life-cycles, and the sequence of entry methods they
execute can be specified in a structured manner, while allowing for some
localized non-determinism (e.g. a pair of methods may execute in any order,
but when they both finish, the execution continues in a pre-determined manner,
say executing a 3rd entry method). To simplify expression of such control
structures, Charm++ provides two methods: the structured dagger notation,
which is the main notation we recommend you use. Alternatively, you may use
threaded entry methods, in combination with futures and sync methods. The
threaded methods run in light-weight user-level threads, and can block waiting
for data in a variety of ways. Again, only the particular thread of a
particular chare is blocked, while the PE continues executing other chares.
</p>
<p>
The normal entry methods, being asynchronous, are not allowed to return any
value, and are declared with a void return type. However, the sync methods are
an exception to this. They must be called from a threaded method, and so are
allowed to return (certain types of) values.
