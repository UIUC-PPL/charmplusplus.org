      <p>Charm++ is a C++-based parallel programming system, supported
      by an adaptive runtime system, which runs programs portably
      from the simple multicore nodes, to the
      largest supercomputers.  The programs specify a parallel
      computation in terms of collections of C++ objects, called chares, that
      interact with each other via asynchronous method invocations.
      (You write your programs in C++, with an additional description of
      interfaces.) Programmers don't concern themselves with where these
      objects are (i.e. on which processors) or when the methods execute. Those
      concerns are left to the runtime system (RTS) to control.  These objects
      are migratable in the sense that the RTS may change their
      placement during execution.  Since there are typically multiple chare
      objects on each processor, the model is also characterized by
      over-decomposition of work and data units.  These features empower an
      adaptive and introspective RTS to support such novel features as
      automatic dynamic load balancing, fault tolerance, and
      automatic overlap of communication and computation.</p>

      </p>Charm++ is a production-quality system, used by scientists and
      engineers in multiple disciplines, with its own debugging and performance
      analysis tools, and with a nightly build system that tests in on dozens
      of combinations of processors, networks, OSs, and compilers.  It is
      installed on most national supercomputers. Charm++ modules can
      interoperate with MPI modules. We welcome you to this website to explore
      Charm++.</p>
