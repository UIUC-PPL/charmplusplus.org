			<p><em>Charm++ is a parallel programming framework in C++, supported by
			an adaptive runtime system, which enhances user productivity and allows
			programs to run portably from small multicore computers (your laptop) to
			the largest supercomputers.</em></p>
			
			<p>It enables users to easily expose and express much of the parallelism
			in their algorithms while automating many of the requirements for high
			performance and scalability. It permits writing parallel programs in
			units that are natural to the domain, without having to deal with
			processors and threads.</p>

			<p>Charm++ has been in production use for over 15 years in the
			scientific, high performance computing community and currently has
			thousands of users in dozens of countries across a wide variety of
			computing disciplines.  It has been adopted by many computing teams, and
			has been used to produce several large, parallel applications. It is
			actively developed, maintained and supported by the
			<a href="ppl.cs.illinois.edu">parallel programming lab</a> at
			<a href="illinois.edu">UIUC</a>, and its collaborators.</p>

			<!--
			<p>Charm++ advocates expressing parallelism in domain-specific units that
			are independent of processors / threads, overdecomposing data and
			computation, concurrency constrained by algorithmic dependencies,
			parallel execution managed by an intelligent runtime system, and higher
			user productivity via a separation of concerns between the application
			developer and the runtime system.</p>

			<p>Users specify a parallel algorithm in terms of collections of C++
			objects, called <em>chares</em>, that interact with each other via
			asynchronous method invocations.  Users simply express the parallel
			algorithm and algorithmic dependencies and are not burdened with
			considerations of which processors or threads these objects live in.
			Charm++ programs are simply written in C++, with additional annotations
			on the objects and methods that are globally visible.</p>

			<p> The Charm++ runtime system manages the locations of these objects,
			delivers any data and method invocations expressed by the program, and
			orchestrates the overall parallel execution.  Users provide serialization
			routines, and the runtime system uses these to dynamically migrate
			objects across processors during execution.  These features empower an
			adaptive and introspective RTS to support the novel feature set that we
			provide.</p>
