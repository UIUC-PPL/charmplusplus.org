			<p>Charm++ is a parallel programming framework in <strong>C++</strong>,
			supported by an adaptive runtime system, which runs programs portably
			from small multicore computers (your laptop) to the largest
			supercomputers. The programs specify a parallel computation in terms of
			collections of C++ objects, called <em>chares</em>, that interact with
			each other via asynchronous method invocations.  Charm++ programs are
			simply written in C++, with an additional description of parallel
			interfaces in separate files.</p>

			<p>Programmers don't concern themselves with where these objects are
			(i.e. on which processors) or when the methods execute. Those concerns
			are left to the runtime system (RTS) to control. These objects are
			migratable in the sense that the RTS may change their placement during
			execution. Since there are typically multiple chare objects on each
			processor, the model is also characterized by over-decomposition of work
			and data units. These features empower an adaptive and introspective RTS
			to support the novel feature set that we provide.</p>

      </p>Charm++ is a production-quality system, used by scientists and
      engineers in multiple disciplines, with its own debugging and performance
      analysis tools, and with a nightly build system that tests in on dozens
      of combinations of processors, networks, OSs, and compilers.  It is
      installed on most national supercomputers. Charm++ modules can
      interoperate with MPI modules. We welcome you to this website to explore
      Charm++.</p>
