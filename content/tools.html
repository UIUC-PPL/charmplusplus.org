	<div id="projectionResearchPage">
	Projections is a performance analysis/visualization framework that helps you understand and investigate performance-related problems in your parallel (CHARM++) application. It is a framework with an event tracing component with features that allow you to control the amount of information generated and to a lesser degree the amount of perturbation the tracing activities introduce into the application. It also has a Java-based visualization and analysis component with various views that will help present the performance information in a visually useful manner. The research page can be found <a href="https://charm.cs.illinois.edu/research/parallel_perf">here</a>.

        <img src="../figs/time-profile.png" height=300 width=830>
        </figure>

        The above two figures show the timeline and time-profile view in Projections.  In the timeline view, user can see the messages between processors. In the time-profile view, user can observe the usage of the application as time goes by.

	<div id="research_header"><h2>Parallel Debugging: Charm Debug</h2></div>
	<br/>
    <div>Charm++ offers a variety of parallel debugging options, from the extremely basic to the extremely sophisticated. The traditional debugging methods, such as logging (via the CkPrintf routine) and interactive debugging (via the "++debug" command line option) are supported under Charm++.
	<br />
	<br />
	In addition, Charm++ offers several additional features designed to simplify application development. Linking with "-memory paranoid" checks all dynamic heap allocation calls for common errors, such as double-delete, random-delete, read-after-delete, buffer over- and under-write errors. Charm++, when compiled without "-DCMK_OPTIMIZE", contains hundreds of assertions to catch invalid parameters and uninitialized data passed to API routines.
	<br />
	<br />
	Charm Debug is a sophisticated parallel debugger, with the ability to
        set breakpoints, examine variables, objects, and messages across the
        entire machine. The design of this debugger is described in the <a href="https://charm.cs.illinois.edu/research/parallel_debug">research page</a>.
