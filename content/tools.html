	<div id="research_header">Parallel Debugging: CharmDebugger</div>
	<br/>
    <div>Charm++ offers a variety of parallel debugging options, from the extremely basic to the extremely sophisticated. The traditional debugging methods, such as logging (via the CkPrintf routine) and interactive debugging (via the "++debug" command line option) are supported under Charm++.
	<br />
	<br />
	In addition, Charm++ offers several additional features designed to simplify application development. Linking with "-memory paranoid" checks all dynamic heap allocation calls for common errors, such as double-delete, random-delete, read-after-delete, buffer over- and under-write errors. Charm++, when compiled without "-DCMK_OPTIMIZE", contains hundreds of assertions to catch invalid parameters and unintialized data passed to API routines.
	<br />
	<br />
	We are working on a sophisticated parallel debugger, with the ability to set breakpoints, examine variables, objects, and messages across the entire machine. The design of this debugger is described in the paper below.

		<p>The latest development version of Charm Debug can be downloaded directly from our source archive. The Git version control system is used, which is available from <a href="http://git-scm.com">here</a>.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
			<p>Check out Charm Debug from the reposiroty:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><tt>$ git clone git://charm.cs.uiuc.edu/ccs_tools.git</tt></li>
			</ul>
			<br />
			</li>
			<li>
			<p>This will create a directory named <tt>ccs_tools</tt>. Move to this directory:</p>
			<p><tt>$ cd ccs_tools</tt></p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p>And now build Charm Debug:</p>
			<p><tt>$ ant</tt></p>

	Projections is a performance analysis/visualization framework that helps you understand and investigate performance-related problems in your parallel (CHARM++) application. It is a framework with an event tracing component with features that allow you to control the amount of information generated and to a lesser degree the amount of perturbation the tracing activities introduce into the application. It also has a Java-based visualization and analysis component with various views that will help present the performance information in a visually useful manner.
