    <h1>Converse Client-Server (CCS) - Stearing the 2D Jacobi Program</h1>

    CCS is a protocol that enables any Charm++ program to act as a server, and
    respond to requests sent by a client. The server will export the actions
    available, and a client (written in C/C++ or Java) can request the server to
    perform any action available.

    <h2>Using CCS</h2>

    In using CCS there are two steps:

    <ol>
      <li>Modify a Charm++ program to add the methods that will perform the
      required operations, and register them to the system;

      <li>Create a client program with the desired user interface to use the
      features exported by the server.
    </ol>

    The server, when launched, will need to be instructed to listen for incoming
    requests. This is performed with the option <b>++server</b>. The option
    <b>++server-port=&lt;number&gt;</b> can be used to force the server to use a
    specific port. The server, while starting, will print the information
    necessary for the client to connect: IP and port number. Following is an
    example:

    <table class="StandardFigure" border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpaddin=5>
        <tr>
          <td align=left valign=top bgColor=bbbbbb>
            <div class="code">
              <code>
                  ccs: Server IP = 192.168.3.23, Server port = 15763
              </code>
            </div>
          </td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h2>Modifying the 2D Jacobi Program</h2>

    The 2D Jacobi program was presented <a href="Basic2DJacobi.html">here</a>. We
    will start with this program as a basis, and extend it to receive request to
    modify values in the grid. When a request is received, the program will
    modify the value and proceed to evolve the system until a new equilibrium is
    reached.

    In Charm++ CCS requests can be mapped to callbacks (see <a
    href="Callbacks.html">here</a> for more info on callbacks). The main function
    to register callbacks to CCS is:

    <table class="StandardFigure" border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpaddin=5>
        <tr>
          <td align=left valign=top bgColor=bbbbbb>
            <div class="code">
              <code>
                 void CcsRegisterHandler(const char *handlerName, const CkCallback &amp;cb);
              </code>
            </div>
          </td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    where <i>handlerName</i> is the string identifier of the CCS request which
    will be sent by the client, and <i>cb</i> is the associated callback that
    will be invoked upon receipt of the request. This registration needs to be
    performed only once in the entire system, therefore an intuitive location do
    do it is inside the mainchare "main" method (the one receiving CkArgMsg as
    parameter). The maximum length of the handler name is 32 characters.

    <p>We can see in the example code, in main.C line 85 and 86, how this is
    performed by registering a callback to the entire jacobi array when there is
    an incoming request named "changeValue", and a callback to the mainchare
    when there is an incoming request named "exit".

    <table class="StandardFigure" border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpaddin=5>
        <tr>
          <td align=left valign=top bgColor=bbbbbb>
            <div class="code">
              <code>
                  <font class="codeComment">// Register the callbacks for CCS</font><br>
                  CcsRegisterHandler("changeValue", CkCallback(CkIndex_Jacobi::ccsRequest(0), jacobiArray));<br>
                  CcsRegisterHandler("exit", CkCallback(CkIndex_Main::terminate(0), mainProxy));
              </code>
            </div>
          </td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <table class="StandardFigure" border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpaddin=5
      align=right>
        <tr>
          <td align=left valign=top bgColor=bbbbbb>
            <div class="code">
              <code>
                struct CkCcsRequestMsg {<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;CcsDelayedReply reply;
                <font class="codeComment">//Object to send reply to.</font><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;int length;
                <font class="codeComment">//Number of bytes of request data.</font><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;char *data;
                <font class="codeComment">//Actual data sent along with request.</font><br>
                };
              </code>
            </div>
          </td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>The method to respond to the callback is registered as a normal entry method
    for the corresponding object. This method receives as input a
    <i>CkCcsRequestMsg</i> which contains the information received from the
    client, as well as the information to reply to such client. The structure of
    CkCcsRequestMsg is shown on the right.

    <p>Being "changeValue" triggered on the entire chare array, every element will
    execute the code. Each element will therefore pull the information out of
    the request, and update the values that belong to it. The format of this
    information must be agreed between client as server. This agreement, in our
    example is in the data structures <i>ChangeRequest</i> and
    <i>SingleValue</i> inside the header file <i>jacobi-CS.h</i> (which is
    included by both the client and the server).

    <p>Once the modification has happened, the array contributes back to the
    mainchare in stepCheckin, and a new iteration will be triggered if the
    modification exceeds the value of the threshold. The computation will then
    continue until a new balance is reached. To notice that this example follows
    the same structure used by the plain Jacobi example, therefore the upper
    left corner of the matrix is maintained fixed at one, and the border of the
    entire matrix is maintained fixed at zero.

    <p>Another modification we made to Jacobi is eliminating the call to CkExit in
    Main::stepCheckin when the equilibrium is reached. This gives the
    possibility to a client to connect and send requests. In this case, to
    terminate the application, the client has to send a request to the CCS
    handler "exit", which will provide to call CkExit.

    <p>In the case of "exit" we have no desire to reply to the client, so we can
    simply ignore it. Nevertheless, in the case of "changeValue" we would like
    to let the client know if the modification has succeded. In order to do
    this, we use the same structure of the request to send back a list of value
    change request that could not be applied by the server (clearly an empty
    list means that everything went ok).

    <p>The only caviat to be careful when replying to the client, is that <b>only
    one single reply is allowed per request</b>. This implies that not every
    element of the chare array can respond to the client, but only one element
    can. In our example, the chare element with index (0, 0) will reply to the
    client.


    <h2>Creating the client</h2>

    Together with the modification of the parallel application to accept
    requests through CCS, we need to create a specific application to generate
    such requests. This application will run on the user's desktop. For this
    example we choose to build the client in C++. The source code and be found
    <a href="examples/Basic2DJacobi_CCS">here</a> together with the server code.

    <p>This client reads two parameters from the command line (the name of the host
    where the server is running and its port, as printed by the server at
    startup), connects to the server, and enters an infinite loop asking the
    user for input. This input, which specifies a position in the matrix to
    modify and its new value, is then converted to a request in the agreed
    format and sent to the server. It then waits for the reply from the server
    before asking the user for the next input. An empty input from the user will
    trigger the other request to the server, the one to terminate.

    <p>To notice that the server does not implement security measures to prevent
    requests coming from a client to corrupt the data. This can happen if a
    request arrives to the server while it is still updating the matrix, before
    it has reached the equilibrium. Here we will consider only the case that the
    user sends requests at the right moment, namely when the server is idle. It
    is left as an exercise to the user to implement a synchronization mechanism
    to allow the server to accept requests at any time, even if the matrix has
    not yet reached an equilibrium.

    <p>Other than the usual system libraries, the client requires to header files. 
    One is <i>jacobi-CS.h</i> which specifies the format of request and replies;
    the other is <i>ccs-client.h</i> which contains the classes and functions
    necessary to use CCS. When compiling, we will still need to use the Charm++
    compiler <i>charmc</i> with a target language of <i>C++</i> and the extra
    flag <i>-seq</i> to specify that the code is sequential and not parallel. 
    Moreover, the dynamic library called <i>ccs-client</i> must be linked in. 
    The command line used to compile the client (present in the makefile) is
    shown here below.
