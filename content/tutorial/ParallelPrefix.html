   It is often useful to perform an operation on an array of values where each value is the sum
   of all the array elements before it.  For example, consider an array <i>V</i> of length <i>N</i>
   with values
   <i>{ v<sub>0</sub>, v<sub>1</sub>, v<sub>2</sub>, v<sub>3</sub>, ... , v<sub>N-1</sub> }.</i>
   We would like to calculate another array <i>V'</i> (also of length <i>N</i>) with the values
   <i>{ v<sub>0</sub>, v<sub>0</sub>+v<sub>1</sub>, v<sub>0</sub>+v<sub>1</sub>+v<sub>2</sub>,
   v<sub>0</sub>+v<sub>1</sub>+v<sub>2</sub>+v<sub>3</sub>, ... }</i>.
   The equation to the right (in Figure 1) shows the resulting value for the
   <i>k<sup>th</sup></i> element where <i>v'<sub>x</sub></i> represents the <i>x<sup>th</sup></i> element
   in the <i>V'</i> array and <i>v<sub>y</sub></i> represents the <i>y<sup>th</sup></i> element in the
   <i>V</i> array.

   There are multiple ways in which the code for the prefix calculation can be written.
   Figure 2 shows two methods of writing the prefix calculation in serial C++ code.  The first
   method is slower but can be parallelized.  The second method is faster (does less overall work)
   but cannot be parallelized because of data dependencies.  The number of
   operations (in this case, additions) that need to be performed in the first method is
   <i>O(N <sup>2</sup>)</i>.  If the value of <i>N</i> is low, doing this calculation
   in serial is not a big deal and will not take long.  However, as <i>N</i> increases, the number
   of operations that need to be performed increases as a function of <i>N <sup>2</sup></i>.
   The second method, which makes the observation that the previous <i>v_prime[]</i> value
   can be used to avoid duplicating calculations, takes <i>O(N)</i> operations.  This is a great
   improvement over the first method and will run substatially faster for large values of <i>N</i>.
   However, it is not as easy to parallelize the second method.  Each iteration of the loop depends
   on the value calculated in the previous iteration creating a chain of data dependencies over the
   course of the entire calculation.  In the first method, each iteration of the outer-loop is independent
   of any other iteration of the outer-loop (they write to different elements of <i>v_prime[]</i> and
   only read from <i>v[]</i>) and therefor could be executed in parallel.  However, the last outer-loop
   iteration will perform <i>N</i> operations (N iterations of the inner-loop) and therefor, if each
   outer-loop iteration were executed on a different processor in parallel, at least one of the
   processors will take <i>O(N)</i> time to complete its iteration of the outer-loop.

   How to perform this calculation in parallel may not be immediately evident.  Before continuing with
   this example, the reader is encouraged to take a few minutes to think about various ways in which
   this calculation could be parallelized.  There are multiple ways in which this calculation can be
   parallelized and only a single method is outlined below.

  <h3>A Parallel Version of the Prefix Calculation</h3>

     <b>Figure 3:</b> Overview of Parallel Prefix Calculation
    </td></tr>
   </table>
  </a>

  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   Since we are writing this program using Charm++, will setup the parallel version of this
   calculation without a worrying about how many processors there are.  Instead, we will write
   the application in terms of chare objects and the length of the array over which the prefix
   calculation should be performed.  To keep things simple at first, we will create an array
   of chare objects where each chare object in the array only contains a single value of the
   array of values.  Initially, each chare object will contain only its corresponding value from
   the array of values.  That is, the chare object at index <i>k</i> in the chare array will
   hold value <i>v<sub>k</sub></i>.  This is shown visually in the first row in Figure 3 and
   represents the initial condition of the chare array.  Note that the first chare object (index 0)
   has the correct final result.
  </p>

  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   First, let start by describing the first step of the calculation.  In the first step of the
   calculation, each chare object in the chare array will simply send a message to its
   neighbor to the right (i.e. send to <i>thisIndex + 1</i>).  The last chare object in the
   chare array, since it has no neighbor to the right, will not send a message.  The sending
   chare object will place its value into the message.  The receiving chare, once it receives
   this message, will add the contained value to it's own.  The resulting state of the chare
   array is shown in Figure 3 as the second row.  Each chare object (except for the first at
   index 0) will now contain a value that is a sum of two values from the original array
   (<i>V</i>).  Once this step has completed, the first and second chare objects (indexes 0
   and 1) will have the correct final results.
  </p>

  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   The second step of the calculation is almost identical to the first.  The only difference is
   that each chare object in the chare array will now send its value to the chare object that
   is two indexes higher than its own (second neighbor to the right).  Because each value contained
   by a chare object is the sum of two values when this step begins, the result will be that each
   chare object will be the sum of four values (2 values sent to it + the two it contains).  Once
   this step has completed, the first four chare objects (indexes 0 through 3) will have the
   correct final results.
  </p>

  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   This process continues until all chare objects have correct final results.  For a given step
   <i>X</i>, each chare object will send a message to the chare object at
   <i>thisIndex + 2<sup>X-1</sup></i>.  After step X has completed, the first <i>2<sup>X</sup></i>
   chare objects in the chare array will have correct final results.  If we set
   <i>2<sup>X</sup> = N</i>, we can conclude that <i>&lceil; log<sub>2</sub>(N) &rceil;</i> overall steps
   in the calculation will be needed.  If we assume that each chare object is on a different
   processor, the overall calculation will take <i>O(log<sub>2</sub>(N))</i> time.
   <font color=ff0000>
    Note:  If we assume that communication costs are small and constant, then this parallel version
    of prefix is faster than either of the serial methods described above for large values of <i>N</i>.

  <h3>Implement It</h3>

  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   Try implementing the parallel prefix calculation in Charm++.  To get you started, here are some
   hints that you might find useful:

   <ul>
    <li style="{margin-bottom:20px;}">
     <b>Makefile</b>:  The Makefile for this application should be very similar to the makefiles
     used in the 
     <a href="ArrayHelloWorld.html">Array</a> and <a href="BroadcastHelloWorld.html">Broadcast</a>
     versions of the "Hello World" examples.
    </li>
    <li style="{margin-bottom:20px;}">
     <b>Initial Values</b>:  Create a chare array and have each chare object assign iself a random
     number in its constructor.
    </li>
    </li>
    <li style="{margin-bottom:20px;}">
     <b>Data Dependencies</b>:  The most straight forward method of ensuring data dependencies are
     met is to create a barrier between the steps.  That is, tell each chare object in the array
     of chare objects to perform a single step of the calculation (e.g.
     <i>PrefixChareClass::doStep(int stepNum)</i> which will send a message to its neighbor at
     <i>I = thisIndex + (1 << stepNum)</i> assuming <i>stepNum</i> is zero-based OR, if <i>I <= N</i>,
     then it directly checks in with the <i>main</i> chare).  Once, the receiving chare object in
     the chare array receives and adds the other chare object's value, have it check in with the
     <i>main</i> chare.  Once the <i>main</i> chare has has received <i>N</i> check in messages,
     it can start the next step (or terminate if <i>O(log<sub>2</sub>(N))</i> steps have been completed).
     Alternatively, you can skip ahead in the tutorial a little bit and read about reductions.  However,
     a barrier is not needed (see <a href="#NoBarriers">No Need for Barriers</a> in the
     <a href="#Extensions">Extensions</a> below).
    </li>
    <li style="{margin-bottom:20px;}">
     <b>Checking Correctness</b>:  The methods used to <i>sayHi()</i> in both the
     <a href="ArrayHelloWorld.html">Array</a> and <a href="BroadcastHelloWorld.html">Broadcast</a>
     versions of the "Hello World" example can be used to display the values before and after the
     prefix calculation to verify correctness.  Using a small value of N, have each chare object
     display its value before the prefix calculation with an output similar to
     "Before: Value[%d] = %lf".  After the prefix calculation, have each chare object display its
     value with an output similar to "After: Value[%d] = %lf".  When you run the program, redirect
     the output to a file, say <i>out.txt</i> and then look at the file using sort (i.e.
     <i>sort out.txt | less</i>).  Regardless of the order in which the CkPrintf()s occur to standard
     output, this will allow you to view the array contents in the proper order.  Once it is working
     for smaller values of <i>N</i>, try larger values.<br><br>

  <h2>Extensions&nbsp;/&nbsp;Performance&nbsp;Considerations</h2>
  </a>

  <h3>Multiple Values per Chare Object</h3>

  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   With only a single value being processes each to a message is sent/received, the overhead of
   performing communication will be much greater than the cost of performing the actual computation.
   Modify the program so that each chare object hold a portion of the <i>V</i> array (i.e. several
   consecutive values instead of just a single value).  This way, each time a chare object receives
   a message, it will preform many operations instead of just a single operation.
  </p>

  <a name="NoBarriers">
  <h3>No Need for Barriers</h3>
  </a>

  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   Without the barrier between steps, there is the possibility of a data race to occur and cause
   your program to produce incorrect results.  Take another look at Figure 3 above.  Lets assume
   that each chare object keeps a counter (<i>stepCounter</i>) which indicates which step that chare
   object is currently in.  Further assume that the entry method which receives values for a chare object
   (<i>receiveValue()</i>) only takes a single
   parameter (the value that is being passed).  In response to receiving the value, this entry
   methods adds the incoming value to its own value, passes the sum onto the next chare object, and
   then increments the step counter which moves this chare object into the next step.  With barriers,
   this would be fine.  However, without the barriers ensuring that all the chare objects are working on
   the same step at any given moment, bad things can happen.  The steps are illustrated below.  Starting at
   initial conditions and assuming that each chare object is on a different processor, a possible
   race condition is as follows (remember, assuming no barriers between steps):

  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   The problem is cause by the fact that messages are not guaranteed to be delivered in the order
   in which they arrived.  If Chare 0, Chare 1, Chare 2, and Chare 3 are on different processors and
   the processor that Chare 2 is located on is slow for some reason (operating system swapped out
   the process, for example) and falls a little behind, then the above sequence of events could easily
   occur.  The barrier would have prevented the chare objects from being in different steps of the
   computation, but without it, race conditions can occur as some chare objects get ahead of other
   chare objects (for whatever reason).
  </p>

  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   As a useful exercise, try extending this program to not use barriers.  Instead, modify the
   <i>receiveValue()</i> entry methods so it takes two parameters: <i>stepFrom</i> and <i>value</i>.
   The value parameter is the same as before.  The <i>stepFrom</i> parameter indicates in which step
   the message was sent (from the point-of-view of the sending chare object; alternatively, the index
   of the sending chare object could be used).  Since each chare object is in a particular step at
   any given moment, when it receives a message, it can check the <i>stepFrom</i> value to see if
   the message has arrived in-order.  If not, it can resend the message to itself (which will cause
   the Charm++ Runtime System to re-queue the message).  Alternatively, the receiving chare object
   could buffer the message and processes it later after the message it was expecting arrives (this
   would be prefered since resending-to-self could potentially occur several times and add significant
   overhead to the program, i.e. resend to self many times and thus execute the <i>receiveValue()</i>
   entry method many times before expected message arrives).

      also (advancing Chare 3 through two steps).

   With this change in place (modification to chare array objects so they don't need to wait for a
   barrier), interaction with the <i>main</i> chare object is no longer needed during the prefix
   computation.  Instead, each chare object in the array would only need to send a single message to
   the <i>main</i> chare object after its stepCounter has reached
   <i>&lceil; log<sub>2</sub>(N) &rceil;</i>.  This helps reduce the required amount of communication
   (assuming buffered messages, not re-sends).  It also alows each chare object to proceed with
   computation based solely
   on data dependencies being met (i.e. it has the data it needs to move forward with its portion of the
   computation).  With the barriers, all chare objects have to wait for the slowest chare object to
   complete the current step before they can move onto the next step even if they already have the data
   they need to continue.

    In simple example programs like this, this effect may not give a large speedup
    (in fact, the additional overhead compared to the tiny amount of work being done, a single addition,
    may even cause a slowdown), however, in actual applications, this can prove quite useful and give
    significant boosts to performance.

   This version of the solution does not have implicit barriers while the prefix calculation
