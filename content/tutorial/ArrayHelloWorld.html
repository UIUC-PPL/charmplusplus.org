  <h1>Array "Hello World": A Slightly More Advanced "Hello World" Program</h1>


  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   Before diving into the next version of the "Hello World" program, we must first introduce a
   few Charm++ concepts: chare arrays and readonly variables.
  </p>

  <h2>Introduction to Chare Arrays and Readonly Variables</h2>

  <h3>Chare Arrays</h3>

  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   It would be cumbersome to have to create many chare objects one by one (especially if
   a program needs to create several instances of the same chare class).  Because of this,
   the concept of a <i>chare array</i> was introduced to Charm++.  As the name implies, a
   chare array is simply an array of chare objects.  The big difference between an array
   of chare objects and any other array is that not all of the chare objects in the array
   have to be located on the same processing element.  By default, the elements of a chare
   array are assigned to the processing elements in a round-robin order (the programmer
   can specify which processing element each chare object in the chare array is created on,
   however, for this example, the default placement will be used).  That is, each
   processing element is given one chare array element until all processing elements have
   one element.  Then, if there are more chare objects in the chare array, each processing
   element gets a second chare object.  This process continues until all of the chare objects
   in the chare array have been assigned to processing elements.  While this program uses
   a 1D chare array, please note that it is also possible to create multi-dimensional chare
   arrays.
  </p>

  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   There are two special variables that can be used by
   elements in a chare array: <i>thisProxy</i> and <i>thisIndex</i>.  Both of these variables
   are similar to the <i>this</i> keyword in C++.  The <i>thisProxy</i> variable points to the
   array that <i>this</i> chare object is in.  The <i>thisIndex</i> variable holds the index
   in the chare array that <i>this</i> chare object occupies (i.e. the first element is at
   index 0, the second at index 1, and so on).
  </p>

  <h3>Readonly Variables</h3>

  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   Readonly variables are special global variables that can be accessed from any chare object
   in the global object space.  As should be clear by now, a Charm++ program begins with the
   constructor of the main chare object (<i>Main::Main()</i> in this example).  When the
   main chare's constructor executes, it should set the values for all of the readonly
   variables in the program.  Once the main chare's constructor has completed, the values
   contained in the readonly variables are distributed to all of the other processing
   elements available to the application.  At this point, the values of the readonly
   variables should only be read since all of the processing elements have a <i>private</i>
   copy of the values (i.e. changing the value of a readonly on one processing element
   will not effect the value of the same readonly on another processing element).
  </p>

  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   For the purpose of this example program, readonly variables serve two purposes.  The
   first is to place a reference to the Main chare object into the global object space
   so that all of the Hello chare objects can invoke entry methods on it.  While all of the
   chare objects in the global object space can invoke entry methods on one another, they
   first need a reference (called a <i>Proxy</i>) to the target chare object.  The second
   purpose is to contain global constants.  In this case, the number of Hello chare objects,
   which can be specified on the command-line by the user, is contained in the
   <i>numElements</i> readonly variable.
  </p>


  <h2>How the Array "Hello World" Program Works</h2>

    </td></tr>
   </table>


  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   There are two chare classes in this version of the "Hello World" program (aka. the Array
   "Hello World" program).  The source code for the chare classes and their entry methods
   is located below.
  </p>

  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   The first chare class is the <i>Main</i> chare class.  This class
   will be the main chare of the application.  It serves three purposes.  First, it will create
   the other chare objects in the application..  Second, it will initiate the <i>computation</i>.
   Third, it will call <i>CkExit()</i> when the calculation is finished to cause the program to exit.
   There will only be a single Main chare object (which is created by the Charm++ Runtime System).
  </p>

  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   The second chare class is the <i>Hello</i> chare class.  The <i>Main</i> chare object will
   create an array of Hello chare object of length <i>N</i>.  Each of the Hello objects will
   print "Hello World" one by one starting with the Hello chare object at index 0, then the
   Hello chare object at index 1, and so on.  Once the last Hello chare object in the array
   has printed "Hello World," it will then send a message to the Main chare object indicating
   that the <i>computation</i> has completed (at which point, the Main chare object will call
   <i>CkExit()</i>).
  </p>

  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   There are four entry methods in this application (ignoring the migration constructors for
   each chare class; two constructors, <i>Main::Main(...)</i> and
   <i>Hello::Hello(...)</i>, and two standard member functions, <i>Hello::sayHi(...)</i> and
   <i>Main::done(...)</i>).
   The constructor of the Main chare class is the entry point of the application.  The
   constructor for the Hello chare class does nothing.  Normally, this is where the local state of
   the chare object (member variables, etc.) would be initialized, however, the Hello chare objects
   do not have any local state.
   The Hello chare class' <i>sayHi()</i> entry method will print out the "Hello World" message
   for the current Hello chare object and then send a message to the next Hello chare object (or,
   in the case of the last Hello chare object in the array, call the <i>done()</i> entry method
   on the Main chare).  The <i>done()</i> entry method for the Main chare class simply calls the
   <i>CkExit()</i> function which terminates the Charm++ program.
  </p>

  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   This example is just meant to demonstrate how a Charm++ program operates (how forward progression
   is made, how chare objects communicate by invoking entry methods, and so on).  This program, while
   it could be executed on multiple processing elements with the chare objects spread out across the
   processing elements, does not have any inherent parallelism in it.  The next "Hello World" program
   (the Broadcast "Hello World" Program) will actually exhibit parallelism.

  <h3>Output</h3>

  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   The output of the Array "Hello World" program is below.  Because there are multiple
   chare objects in this program, the chare objects can be spread out over the various
   processing elements in use.  For these runs, three processing elements (x86 workstations
   running linux) were used.  The specific command used was <i>./charmrun +p3 ./hello 10</i>.
   The <i>charmrun</i> program is used to launch the application on all the hosts.  The
   <i>+p3</i> indicates that three processing elements should be used (the first three
   hosts in the <a href="CharmComponents.html#NodelistFile">nodelist file</a>).  The <i>./hello</i> indicates the Charm++ program that
   should be executed.  Everything following the <i>./hello</i> is passed to the Charm++
   program as command-line arguments.

   The output above may seem a bit confusing at first.  The output from Run 1 is probably
   what one would expect, that is, until the last two lines are read.  With just a quick
   glance, it seems that the <i>helloArray[9].sayHi()</i> entry method was called before the
   <i>helloArray[8].sayHi()</i> entry method.  However, with closer inspection, one will
   notice that the "told by" portion of the lines indicates that they were indeed executed
   in the correct order.  So, why are the lines out of order?  Also notice that those chare
   objects were located on different processing elements.  Even though <i>helloArray[8].sayHi()</i>
   was executed before <i>helloArray[9].sayHi()</i>, it's output still needs to be packed into
   a message and passed back to a single location where the output is collected and presented to the
   user as a single stream of output.  The output of <i>helloArray[9].sayHi()</i>, while it was
   sent later, was received earlier.  The output of Run 2 is an even more extreme version of what
   can happen.  Even though the program is executing as expected, there is a race condition in
   the process of the output being serialized since the processors do not synchronize with one
   another for the sake of printing output.
  </p>

  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   This interleaving of tasks is a common issue in parallel programming in  general and
   something that makes writing a parallel program more difficult than writing a serial program.
   By their very nature, parallel programs have multiple processing elements acting independently
   of one another.  When two or more processing elements have to perform a set of tasks in a particular
   order (i.e. task <i>A</i> must complete on processing element <i>X</i> before task <i>B</i> can
   begin on processing element <i>Y</i>) the processing elements must synchronize.  With little
   synchronization, the processing elements are, for the most part, acting independently from one
   another (i.e. the processing elements are free to do local computation without having to
   communicate with other processing elements).  Adding more synchronization will help
   keep the processing elements performing tasks in a specified order, however, this also tends to
   introduce more overhead and will likely decrease concurrency which hurts overall performance.
   In this example program, the tasks that can change order are the printing of output statements,
   however, in many parallel applications, the various subtasks in the computation itself are
   usually free to execute in any order per the dependencies in the calculation.
  </p>
