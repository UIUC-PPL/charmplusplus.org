  <h1>Pack-UnPack (PUP) Routines</h1>


  <h2>Object Migration</h2>

  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   One of the main advantages of having an application broken down into a set of chare objects
   is that the chare objects are <i>migratable</i>.  By migratable, we mean that no one chare
   object is tied to a particular processing element.  Because of this, the Charm++ Runtime
   System can freely <i>migrate</i> the chare objects in a Charm++ application between the
   processing elements available.  There are numerous reasons for doing this.
  </p>

  <ul>

   <li style="{margin-bottom:15px;}">
    <b>Load-Balancing:</b>  The most obvious reason for wanting to migrate objects is the
    ability to balance the workloads of the various processing elements.  If a few processing
    elements, or even just a single processing element, is overloaded, the rest of the processing
    elements will become idle.  This wastes precious processing cycles and results in an overall
    degradation of the application's performance.  By dynamically migrating the chare objects
    between the processing elements, the Charm++ Runtime System is able to re-balance the workloads
    of the processing elements based on actual runtime data so that all of the processing elements
    are being fully utilized.

   <li style="{margin-bottom:15px;}">
    <b>Fault Tolerance:</b>  Another benefit of being able to migrate objects is being able to
    duplicate objects (either on disk for a checkpoint or in-memory to enabling dynamic fault
    recovery).  If one of the processing elements were to fail/crash during the execution
    of a Charm++ application, the duplicated object states can then be recovered and the
    lost object recreated while the rest of the application (i.e. chare objects on unaffected
    processing elements) continues to execute.  Furthermore, if the Charm++ Runtime System is
    <i>warned</i> by the underlying system that a processing element or node is about to fail
    (e.g. temperature sensor warning), the chare objects on that particular processing element(s)
    can be migrated away from the defective hardware in an attempt to avoid the fault altogether.

   <li style="{margin-bottom:15px;}">
    <b>Shrinking/Growing Executions:</b>  As a Charm++ application is executing, the load of the overall
    cluster may changed (i.e. another job is launched, a more important job is launched, another
    job may complete freeing processing elements, and so on).  Because the chare objects can be
    moved around freely, the Charm++ application can dynamically move objects onto and off of
    processing elements.  Effectively, this give a Charm++ application the ability to abandon
    processing elements that it is currently using (freeing them for other activities) or to
    <i>migrate</i> work onto newly available processing elements.  Once again, this can be done
    dynamically by the Charm++ Runtime System while the Charm++ application continues to run.

   <li style="{margin-bottom:15px;}">
    <b>Parameter Marshling:</b>  Generally speaking, an object (not just chare objects; C++ objects,
    C structures, and so on) can have PUP routines.  Any object that has a PUP routine can then be
    passed as an argument in an entry method invokation.

  </ul>

  <h2>Pack-UnPack (PUP) Routines</h2>

  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   What makes object migration possible is the ability to serialize the state of a chare object
   into a contiguous peice of memory (i.e. a message, a file, and so on).  By seriallizing the
   state of the chare object, the chare object can be recreated, along with its state, at a later
   time and potentially in a different location such as another processing element.  See the figure
   to the right.  For a chare
   object to be able to undergo object migration, it must have a <i>Pack-UnPack</i> or PUP routine.
   The PUP routine performs the tasks of <i>sizing</i>, <i>packing</i> (serializing), and <i>unpacking</i>
   (deserializing) the chare object.
  </p>

  <ul>

   <li style="{margin-bottom:15px;}">
    <b>Sizing:</b> <i>(On source processing element)</i> First, the PUP routine is called by the
    Charm++ Runtime System to measure how much memory will be needed (i.e. the size of the buffer)
    to encapsulate the state of the chare object.  Once the size of the buffer is known, the buffer
    is allocated by the Charm++ Runtime System.

   <li style="{margin-bottom:15px;}">
    <b>Packing:</b> <i>(On source processing element)</i> Second, the PUP routine is called again
    to actually pack the state of the chare object into the buffer.

   <li style="{margin-bottom:15px;}">
    <b>Migration:</b> At this point, the buffer can be sent to another processing element via a
    message, it can be stored into a file on a hard disk for later use (checkpoint), and so on.

   <li style="{margin-bottom:15px;}">
    <b>Unpacking:</b> <i>(On target processing element)</i> Finally, once the buffer arrives to
    its target processing element, the PUP routine is called again to unpack the state of the
    chare object thus recreating the chare object that was originally packed on the source
    processing element.

  </ul>

  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   The process of object migration, can be controlled by the Charm++ application.  By default,
   the Charm++ Runtime System can initiate object migration for a chare object at any time (as
   long as the chare objects isn't currently executing an entry method).  However, it is possible
   for the Charm++ application to indicate that object migrations should only occur at specific
   times when it is safe to do so.

   The code example to the right contains an example chare object with its associated PUP routine.
   The process of migrating the object is outlined below.
  </p>

  <ul>

   <div style="{margin-bottom:15px; margin-left:15px;}"><b>Source Processing Element</b></div>

   <li style="{margin-bottom:15px; margin-left:15px;}">
    <b>Step 1 - Call to <i>ckAboutToMigrate()</i>:</b> Optionally, one can override the virtual
    member function <i>ckAboutToMigrate()</i> in their chare class.  If this is done, this member
    function will be called on the chare object before the process of packing the chare object
    begins.
   </li>

   <li style="{margin-bottom:15px; margin-left:15px;}">
    <b>Step 2 - Sizing:</b> <i>MyChare::pup()</i> is called with a sizing <i>PUP::er</i>.  When this
    occurs, the <i>| (pipe)</i> and <i>() (parenthesis)</i> operators simply do a <i>sizeof</i>
    operation.  The sizing <i>PUP::er</i> can then accumulate the sizes of all the data that
    needs to be packed.
   </li>

   <li style="{margin-bottom:15px; margin-left:15px;}">
    <b>Step 3 - Packing:</b> <i>MyChare::pup()</i> is called a second time with a packing
    <i>PUP::er</i>.  This time, the <i>| (pipe)</i> and <i>() (parenthesis)</i> operators copy
    the data from the variable specified (or what the variable points to for pointers) into the
    buffer allocated by the Charm++ Runtime System.
   </li>

   <li style="{margin-bottom:15px; margin-left:15px;}">
    <b>Step 4 - Destructor:</b> <i>MyChare::~MyChare()</i> is called to destroy the object.
    Note that this step only occurs if the chare object is being destroyed on the source processor
    (e.g. if the object is migrating).  This step would be skipped if the chare object's state
    is simply being checkpointed (and thus the heapArray is free'd in the destructor and not in the
    PUP routine).
   </li>

   <div style="{margin-bottom:15px; margin-left:15px;}"><i>(message containing chare object sent across the interconnect)</i></div>

   <div style="{margin-bottom:15px; margin-left:15px;}"><b>Destination Processing Element</b></div>

   <li style="{margin-bottom:15px; margin-left:15px;}">
    <b>Step 5 - Constructor:</b> <i>MyChare::MyChare(CkMigrateMessage *msg)</i> is called to create
    the chare object on the destination processing element.
   </li>

   <li style="{margin-bottom:15px; margin-left:15px;}">
    <b>Step 6 - UnPacking:</b> <i>MyChare::pup()</i> is called for a third time with an unpacking
    <i>PUP::er</i>.  This time, the <i>| (pipe)</i> and <i>() (parenthesis)</i> operators copy the
    data from the buffer into the variable specified (or what the variable points to for pointers).
   </li>

   <li style="{margin-bottom:15px; margin-left:15px;}">
    <b>Step 7 - Call to <i>ckJustMigrated()</i>:</b> Optionally, one can override the virtual
    member function <i>ckJustMigrated()</i> in their chare class.  If this is done, this member
    function will be called on the chare object after the process of unpacking the chare object
    has completed.
   </li>

  </ul>

  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   <font color=ff0000>Please Note: The code to the right assumes that (1) the migration constructor,
   <i>MyChare::MyChare(CkMigrateMessage *msg)</i>, does not allocate memory for heapArray and that
   (2) the heapArray pointer points to something by the time the object migration process begins.
   A similar technique, as was used for heapArray in this example, can be used for handling the opening
   and closing of files, and so on.
