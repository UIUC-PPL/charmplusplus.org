  <h1>LiveViz <i>(using the 2D Jacobi Program)</i></h1>




  <h2>LiveViz</h2>

  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   <a href="http://charm.cs.illinois.edu/manuals/html/libraries/2.html">LiveViz</a> is a library (module) that enables a Charm++ application to present output to the user
   in a graphical form as the program continues to execute.  More specifically, an image is created
   for a chare array.  Each chare object in the chare array <i>contributes</i> to the image.  Once
   all of the chare objects in the chare array have contributed their portion of the image, the combined
   image is presented to the user via a LiveViz client application which displays the image.

  <h2>How to Use LiveViz</h2>

  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   First, a special entry method is declared for the chare array.  Specifically, an entry method that
   takes a <i>liveVizRequestMsg</i> message.  This message contains various pieces of information
   including the size of the display area in the LiveViz client program (that is, the size of the area
   where the chare array can draw to).  A callback object is created that points to this particular
   entry method.
  </p>

  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   Second, after the chare array is created, LiveViz must be configured.  LiveViz can
   be configured to create both grayscale and color images (and floating-point <i>images</i> which will be
   converted to a color images).  LiveViz can also be configured to control when the image is updated:
   when the program triggers it, when the client triggers it, or to be continuously updated.  The
   configuration is contained in an object called a <i>liveVizConfig</i> object.
  </p>

  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   Third, LiveViz is then <i>initialized</i> for a chare array and configuration object pair.  Once this
   occurs, the chare array can create a LiveViz image which can give the user information related to
   its current state.
  </p>


  <h2>Revisiting the Basic 2D Jacobi Program</h2>

  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   The Basic 2D Jacobi program (which was originally presented <a href="Basic2DJacobi.html">here</a>)
   will be extended to provide LiveViz support.  In the original Basic 2D Jacobi program, there was
   only a single point being held constant over the entire value matrix.  To make the LiveViz output
   more interesting, the Basic 2D Jacobi program has been modified to have several areas held constant.
   In particular, every chare object (except for the first row of chare objects) will hold the
   first row of its local value sub-matrix at a constant value.  The constant values will alternate
   for neighboring chare objects (to create a checkerboard like pattern).
  </p>

  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   The values in the value matrix fall between the values of 0.0 and 1.0.  If we imagine
   that they represent a temperature value on a 2D surface, with 0.0 being <i>cold</i> and 1.0 being
   <i>hot</i>, then the resulting image will be a temperature image of the 2D surface.
  </p>

  <h3>Modifying the Basic 2D Jacobi Program</h3>

  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   A modified version of the Basic 2D Jacobi program can be found
   <a href="examples/Basic2DJacobi_LiveViz.tar.gz">here (Basic2DJacobi_LiveViz.tar.gz)</a>.
   In addition to changing which value
   elements are held constant, several <i>sleep</i> calls have been added to slow the code down so
   user can both have time to connect the LiveViz client and time to see the image change slowly.
  </p>

  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   First, as is described above, an entry method that takes a <i>liveVizRequestMsg</i> message must be
   created.  The prototype for this function should fit the form
   <b><code>void MyChareClass::myLiveVizEntryMethod(liveVizRequestMsg* msg)</code></b> where
   <i>MyChareClass</i> is the name of the chare class and <i>myLiveVizEntryMethod</i> is the name of
   the entry method.  At some point in this function, a call to the <i>liveVizDeposit</i> function.
   The prototype for the <i>liveVizDeposit</i> function is
   <b><code>liveVizDeposit(msg, startX, startY, width, height, imageBuff, this, max_image_data)</code></b>.
   The important parameters are as follows: <i>msg</i> is a pointer to the <i>liveVizRequestMsg</i> that
   was passed to the entry method, <i>startX</i> and <i>startY</i> are the X and Y coordinates of the upper
   left corner of the sub-image contributed by this chare object, <i>width</i> and <i>height</i> are the
   width and height of the sub-image contributed by this chare object, <i>imageBuff</i> is a pointer to
   a data buffer containing the image data for the sub-image (the format of which depends on the type of
   image being produced), and <i>this</i> is the special C++ <i>this</i> pointer.  The final parameter,
   in this case <i>max_image_data</i>, is used to control how image data is combined when multiple chare
   objects product data to overlapping areas of the image (that is, when one or more sub-images created by
   chare objects overlap with one another).
  </p>

  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   In the case of the Basic 2D Jacobi program, each of the Jacobi chare objects in the 2D chare array
   have an independent, non-overlapping portion of the overall value matrix (their local sub-matrix).
   Because of this, none of the sub-images create by the chare objects will overlap with one another.
   To keep the code simple, the resulting image will have a single pixel per element in the value matrix.
   The width and height of the client's drawing area will be ignored to keep the code simple and straight
   forward.  In the example code, the name of the entry method is
   <i>Jacobi::liveVizFunc()</i> and the code for it can be found in <i>jacobi.C</i>.
  </p>

  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   Second, a <i>liveVizConfig</i> object containing configuration data for LiveViz must be created.
   For this example, a color image is created and will be continuously updated.
  </p>

  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   Third, LiveViz is initialized with the chare array and configuration object pair.  The code for
   doing both the second and third steps can be found in <i>Main::Main()</i> in <i>main.C</i>.
  </p>

  <h3>Running the Basic 2D Jacobi Program</h3>

  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   When the Charm++ program is started, it must
   specify that it will act as a <i>CCS server</i>.  To do this add the following options to the
   command line used to launch the Charm++ program: <b><code>++server ++server-port xxxx</code></b> where
   <i>xxxx</i> is the port number where the Charm++ application will listen for CCS messages.  LiveViz
   uses CCS to communicate with the Charm++ application.
  </p>

  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   Once the Charm++ program has been started, a
   LiveViz client program can attach to it.  One LiveViz client program can be found at
   <i>[charmDir]/java/bin/liveViz</i> where <i>[charmDir]</i> is the base directory for the Charm++
   distribution.  This LiveViz client program expects two command line arguments: (1) <i>host</i> which
   is the name of the machine on which the <i>charmrun</i> command was executed and (2) <i>port</i> which is
   the port number the Charm++ application is listening for CCS messages on (should match the <i>xxxx</i>
   specified for the <i>++server-port xxxx</i> command line option given to <i>charmrun</i>).
  </p>
