  <h1>Components of a Charm++ Program</h1>

  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   Remember that Charm++ is based on the C++ programming language and uses an object-oriented
   style of programming.  With this in mind, let's recap on what is needed for a basic C++
   application.  Each class in the C++ program needs two things, a class definition and
   function bodies for all it's member functions.  The class definition defines what member
   functions the class has along with what state the class has (member variables).   The
   function bodies contain the code that is executed when one of the member functions is
   invoked.  Traditionally, these two items are kept in separate files (the class definition
   in the ".h" or header file and the function bodies in the ".cpp" or source file).  Keep in
   mind that having these items in separate files is just common practice.  It is possible to
   have function bodies contained in the class definition, to have the class definition
   in the source file, and so on.  Presenting these items in this manner is only meant to give
   the reader a clear idea of the components needed.

    Please note: For Charm++ programs, it is common to see the ".C" file extension used
    instead of the ".cpp" file extension for source files.  Using either extension is fine.
   </i></font>
  </p>
   
  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   Chare classes need one additional peice of information, the interface definition.  The
   interface definition specifies which member functions can be remotely invoked by other
   chare objects in the global object space.  This information is contained in a ".ci" or
   interface file.
  </p>

  
  <!-- Compilation Process -->
  <h2>Compilation Process</h2>

  <h3>Charmc</h3>

  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   Charmc is a Charm++ tool that <i>wraps</i> the native compiler.  By <i>native compiler</i>
   we mean whatever compiler happens to be installed on the machine where the Charm++
   application is being compiled.  The purpose of charmc is to allow the makefiles used to
   compile Charm++ programs as portable as the Charm++ programs themselves.  The
   programmer writes the Makefile files using the charmc command instead of directly
   calling the native C++ compiler.  Charmc is available on all platforms that the Charm++
   Runtime System is also available on.  Charmc also provides some additional capability
   beyond just wrapping the native C++ compiler (such as wrapping the charmxi tool described
   below, and so on) but this will not be covered here.
  </p>

  <h3>Charmxi and the Interface File</h3>

  <!-- Figure -->
  <table class="StandardFigure" border=0 align=right>
   <tr><td align=center valign=middle>
    <a class="StandardFigure" href="images/ChareClassCompileProcess.jpg">

   <tr><td align=center valign=middle>

   </td></tr>
  </table>

  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   The interface file is processed by a Charm++ tool called <i>charmxi</i>
   the result of which is a set of "decl.h" and "def.h" files.  These files contain
   auto-generated code that <i>hooks</i> the programmer's application code to the Charm++
   Runtime System.  This auto-generated code is then <i>included</i> into the associated
   source file when the source file is compiled.  Figure 2 (to the right) shows the compilation
   process for a single chare class.  First, the interface file is processed by the
   charmxi tool which auto-generates some code needed by the Charm++ Runtime System.  Next,
   the source file, with the associated #include lines for the generated files, is compiled
   in a manner similar to a class in C++.  The result is an object file that contains the
   chare class.
  </p>

  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   After all of the chare classes for an application have been compiled, charmc
   is once again used to link all of them together.  It is during this link step when the
   Charm++ Runtime System is also linked into the application.
  </p>
  
  
  <h2>Running a Charm++ Program</h2>
     
  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   When charmc
   creates the final executable, another program called <i>charmrun</i> will also be created in
   the same directory as the executable.  Charm++ applications can be executed in two ways.
   The first is to simply run the executable.  This is refered to as <i>standalone mode</i>
   which means that the program is only being executed on the local machine using a single
   processor.  The second is way to run a Charm++ program is to launch it using the
   charmrun program.
  </p>

  <h3>Charmrun</h3>

  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   When a Charm++ program is launched using the charmrun program, the number of processors to
   use, amongst other things, is specified by using the <i>+p#</i> command line argument (
   where the <i>#</i> is replaced by the actual number of processors to use).  For example,
   one might use the command "charmrun +p4 ./myProgram" to launch the Charm++ program called
   <i>myProgram</i> on four processors.  The processors available for use by charmrun are
   specified in a <i>nodelist</i> file.
  </p>

  <h3>The Nodelist File</h3>

   <table border=0 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0 align=right>
    <tr>
     <td align=left valign=middle bgColor=bbbbbb>
      <div class="code">
       <code>
        group main ++shell ssh<br>
        host alpha<br>
        host bravo<br>
        host charlie<br>
        host delta<br>
        host alpha<br>
        host bravo
       </code>
      </div>
     </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td colspan=2 align=center valign=middle>
      <b>Figure 3:</b> Example Nodelist File
     </td>
    </tr>
   </table>

  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   The nodelist file specifies what processors are available to a Charm++ program when it
   is launched using charmrun.  Figure 3 contains an example nodelist file.  The lines
   beginning with <i>host</i> specify what processors are available for use by
   charmrun.  The processors are used in-order by the charmrun.  For example, if charmrun is
   used to launch a Charm++ program using two processors, then a single process will be launched
   on each of the hosts <i>alpha</i> and <i>bravo</i>.  If four processors are needed, then
   all of the hosts in this example nodelist file (<i>alpha</i>, <i>bravo</i>, <i>charlie</i>,
   and <i>delta</i>) will have a single process running on them.  If a single
   machine/node has more than one processor, it can be listed multiple times in the nodelist
   file, however, the hosts are still used in order from the nodelist file.  In this example,
   the machines <i>alpha</i> and <i>bravo</i> have two processors each.  If five processors
   are needed by charmrun, all of the hosts will have a single process running on them
   except for <i>alpha</i> which will have two processes running on it.
   <font color=ff0000><i>
    Please Note: If number of processors used by charmrun is greater than the number of
    <i>host</i> lines specified in the nodelist file, charmrun will loop around on the list and
    start using host lines from the beginning of the list.  Additionally, some target platforms
    do not require the user to specify a nodelist file since the processors are dynamically
    assigned upon job creation.
   </i></font>
  </p>

  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   The <i>++nodelist</i> command line option can be used to specify the nodelist
   file to use when executing a Charm++ program using charmrun.  If this command line options
   is not specified, charmrun defaults to using "~/.nodelist" for the nodelist file.
