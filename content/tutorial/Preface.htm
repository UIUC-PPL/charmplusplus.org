  <h2>What the Reader Should Know Before Starting</h2>
  
  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   The reader is expected to be familiar with the C++ programming language and, at least,
   the basics of the object-oriented programming style used in C++.  The reader is also
   recommended to have a basic understanding of multiple "threads of execution" or concurrency.
   Previous experience in parallel programming will help, but is not required.

   The Charm++ distribution, which contains the the Charm++ Runtime System and related tools, libraries,
   and so on, can be downloaded
