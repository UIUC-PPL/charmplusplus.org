  <h1>Building the Charm++ Runtime System</h1>

  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   In the root directory of the Charm++ distribution is a <i>build</i> script.  This build script
   is used to compile the Charm++ Runtime System for a particular platform.  The exact platform that
   should be used depends on the setup of the machine being used by the user.  For the sake of this
   example, we will assume that the target platform is a cluster of linux workstations.
   <font color=ff0000><i>
    Please Note:  If the build script is executed with the "--help" command-line argument
    (i.e. the command "./build --help"), it will print out a usage message which includes a list
    of platforms available.
   </i></font>
  </p>

  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   The general usage form of the build script is:<br><br>
  </p>

   <center><b><code>
    build &lt;target&gt; &lt;version&gt; &lt;options&gt; [ charmc-options ... ]
   </code></b></center>

  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   where:
  </p>

  <ul>
   <li style="{margin-bottom:10px;}">
       <b>&lt;target&gt;:</b> This indicates which portion of the Charm++ distribution should be
       built.  Because there are many components to the Charm++ distribution this allows the user
       to only build the portions that are needed for their purpose.  Targets include: charm++, AMPI,
       FEM, LIBS, bigemulator, pose, jade, and msa.  For example, the charm++ target builds the
       basic Charm++ Runtime System. The LIBS target builds additional libraries with various
       functionality (also builds the charm++ target on which it depends).  If the pose target is
       used, both charm++ and LIBS targets will be built followed
       by the pose target.  The pose target will create the required libraries needed for applications
       that will use its PDES functionality.
   <li style="{margin-bottom:10px;}">
       <b>&lt;version&gt;:</b> This is one of the available platforms.  For a cluster of linux
       workstations connected using an Ethernet network, the target platform is <i>net-linux</i>.
       For the full list of supported platforms, use "./build --help".
   <li style="{margin-bottom:10px;}">
       <b>&lt;options&gt;</b> <i>(Optional)</i><b>:</b> This is where platform specific options
       should be specified.  For example, multiple compilers are supported for various platforms.
       If the user wishes to use a compiler different from the default compiler for the platform,
       this would be specified here.  Other platform specific options can include options for the
       type of network, SMP-mode, PAPI support, and so on.
   <li style="{margin-bottom:10px;}">
       <b>[ charmc-options ... ]</b> <i>(Optional)</i><b>:</b> This is where compiler specific
       options can be specified.  The compiler wrapper charmc will use the options specified here
       by default when it is used to compile Charm++ programs.  The compiler that it wraps is
       either the default compiler for the platform or the user defined compiler specified in
       the <i>&lt;options&gt;</i> portion of the build command.
  </ul> </body> </html>

  <h3>Examples</h3>

  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   <b>(1)</b> For a cluster of Linux workstations connected by an Ethernet network (32-bit x86 architecture):
   <code><b>./build charm++ net-linux</b></code><br>

   <b>(2)</b> 1 with SMP support:
   <code><b>./build charm++ net-linux smp</b></code><br>

   <b>(3)</b> 1 with the "-O3" compiler option on by default for charmc:
   <code><b>./build charm++ net-linux "-O3"</b></code><br>

   <b>(4)</b> 1 with both SMP support and the "-O3" compiler option on by default for charmc:
   <code><b>./build charm++ net-linux smp "-O3"</b></code><br>

  </p>

  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   <font color=ff0000><i>
    WARNING:  Depending on the speed of the machine being used and the options specified, the build
    process of the Charm++ Runtime System can take several minutes (as high as 10-20 minutes for
    older machines).
