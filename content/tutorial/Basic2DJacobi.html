  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   The Jacobi calculation is another useful example.  The idea is simple.  There is some data
   set (1D, 2D, 3D, etc. array of values) which is updated in an iterative processes until some
   condition is met.  For this example, we will compute a new value for each element in a 2D
   matrix.  The element's new value will be the average of the element's current value and the
   current values of its four neighbors.  We will do this for every
   element in the matrix (an <i>iteration</i>).  At the end of each iteration, the maximum
   value change will be determined.  That is, for each element in the matrix, the value change is the
   difference between the old value and the new value.  That maximum of all the value changes is
   calculated across the entire 2D matrix.  If the maximum value change for a given iteration is
   below a given threshold, then the Jacobi calculation ends.  Otherwise, the next iteration starts.
   Figure 1 to the right has the C++ code for a serial version of the 2D Jacobi calculation
   described above.

  <h2>Parallelizing 2D Jacobi</h2>

  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   There is a lot of potential to parallelize the Jacobi calculation.  While each outer-loop
   iteration requires the output of the previous iteration, each iteration of the outer-loop
   can be parallelized.  Notice the two <i>for</i>-loops (which will collectively be referred to as the
   <i>inner-loop</i>).  Each iteration of the inner-loop writes to a different element of the
   <i>outMatrix</i> and only reads values from the <i>inMatrix</i>.  Because of this, the
   calculation of each element's new value along with the element's difference (<i>diff</i> value
   in the code) can be performed in parallel.
  </p>

  <h3>Decomposing a Single Outer-Loop Iteration</h3>

  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   The main decision is how to decompose the iterations of the inner-loop into sets (with the
   idea being that a single chare object will perform all inner-loop iterations within a single
   set).  For now, we will ignore the code in the inner-loop that updates <i>maxDiff</i> (i.e.
   "<code>if (diff > maxDiff) maxDiff = diff;</code>").  For this example, we will break down
   the matrix into blocks (that is several 2D sub-matrices).  Each chare object will have a single
   2D sub-matrix and perform the corresponding iterations of the inner-loop on those matrix
   elements.  Figure 2 depicts this decomposition visually for the entire matrix.
  </p>

  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   Figure 3 (below) zooms in on a single chare object and the eight surrounding chare objects (assuming the
   center chare object is not one of the border elements).  The <i>jacobiArray</i> refers to a 2D array
   of Jacobi chare objects (the name used in the example code below).  Five <i>events</i> have to occur each
   step before the chare object can perform its local calculation.  They are as follows <i>(Please Note:
   these events can occur in any order)</i>:
  </p>

  <ul>
   <li style="{margin-bottom:20px;}">
    <b>A</b>:  The chare object to the <i>east</i> (x+1,y) sends its west-most
               column of data to <i>this</i> chare object (x,y).  The data is copied from the
               message into the <i>east</i> ghost data location.
   </li>
   <li style="{margin-bottom:20px;}">
    <b>B</b>:  The chare object to the <i>south</i> (x,y+1) sends its north-most
               row of data to <i>this</i> chare object (x,y).  The data is copied from the
               message into the <i>south</i> ghost data location.
   </li>
   <li style="{margin-bottom:20px;}">
    <b>C</b>:  The chare object to the <i>west</i> (x-1,y) sends its east-most
               column of data to <i>this</i> chare object (x,y).  The data is copied from the
               message into the <i>west</i> ghost data location.
   </li>
   <li style="{margin-bottom:20px;}">
    <b>D</b>:  The chare object to the <i>north</i> (x,y-1) sends its south-most
               row of data to <i>this</i> chare object (x,y).  The data is copied from the
               message into the <i>north</i> ghost data location.
   </li>
   <li style="{margin-bottom:20px;}">
    <b>E</b>:  This chare object (x,y) must likewise send out ghost data to each of its
               four neighbors (assuming it is not a border chare object).  This is done in
               a manner similar to how each of the incoming ghost data messages were sent.
   </li>
  </ul>

  </table>

  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   Once each of these events have occurred, the local chare object (x,y) is then ready to do the
   Jacobi calculation on its local data (similar to the inner-loop calculation in the serial C++
   code in Figure 1 except only on the local sub-matrix instead of the entire values matrix).
   However, the <i>maxDiff</i> value calculated will only be the maxDiff found in the local
   sub-matrix.  The global <i>maxDiff</i> must be calculated from all the local <i>maxDiff</i>
   values.
  </p>


  <h3>Handling <i>maxDiff</i></h3>

  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   The only challenge to parallelizing the inner-loop iterations is the calculation of the
   <i>maxDiff</i> value.  This scalar value is both read and written by each iteration of the
   inner-loop.  However, this is easily overcome if one notices that the operation being performed
   on the <i>maxDiff</i> variable, <code>maxDiff = max(maxDiff, diff)</code>, is both
   associative and commutative.  Because of this, it doesn't matter what order the
   individual <i>max</i> operations are performed in.  As long as they are all performed, the same
   answer will be reached.  Therefor, each chare object in the chare matrix can perform the
   <i>maxDiff</i> operations local to it.  All of the <i>local maxDiff</i> values can then be
   collected into a single location and then combined using the same <i>max</i> operator.
  </p>

  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   The type of role <i>maxDiff</i> is playing in this code is a common one in parallel programs
   in general.  This pattern is referred to as a <i>reduction</i>.  The Charm++ model and the Charm++
   Runtime System have special support for handling reductions of various types (including
   user-defined reductions).  For the sake of this example, we will perform the reduction manually.
   For more information on using built-in support for reductions within Charm++, please refer to
   <a href="http://charm.cs.uiuc.edu/manuals/html/charm++/3_14Reductions.html">Section 3.14 "Reductions"</a> of
   <a href="http://charm.cs.uiuc.edu/manuals/html/charm++/manual.html">The Charm++ Programming Language Manual</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Implement It</h3>

  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   Try implementing the 2D Jacobi calculation in Charm++.  To get you started, here are some
   hints that you might find useful:

   <ul>
    <li style="{margin-bottom:20px;}">
     <b>Makefile</b>:  The Makefile for this application should be very similar to the makefiles
     used in the
     <a href="ArrayHelloWorld.html">Array</a> and <a href="BroadcastHelloWorld.html">Broadcast</a>
     versions of the "Hello World" examples.
    </li>
    <li style="{margin-bottom:20px;}">
     <b>Initial Values</b>:  Create a chare array and have each chare object initialize its portion
     of the overall 2D matrix with values of zero.  During the calculation, at some code that holds
     a portion of the values constant.  For example, hold <code>inMatrix[0][0] = 1.0</code> or hold
     the entire first row's and/or first column's values at 1.0.
    </li>
   </ul>

  </p>

  <h3>Solution</h3>

  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   A simple solution for this problem can be found
   <a href="examples/Basic2DJacobi.tar.gz">here (Basic2DJacobi.tar.gz)</a>.
  </p>

  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   NOTE: In this solution, there is a "#define DISPLAY_MATRIX" line in the <i>common.h</i> header file which
   controls whether or not the chare objects will display their portion of the matrix during each step
   of the calculation.  By default, the output is disabled as it can be quite a bit of output depending on
   the parameters that are used for the application.  To see the values in the matrix during each step,
   set DISPLAY_MATRIX to a non-zero value.
  </p>


  <h2>Extensions&nbsp;/&nbsp;Performance&nbsp;Considerations</h2>

  <h3>No Need for Barriers</h3>

  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   As was the case with the <a href="ParallelPrefix.html">Parallel Prefix example</a>, the implicit
   barrier created by contacting the main chare each iteration is not needed.  Instead, once the data
   dependencies created by passing ghost information between the chare objects are satisfied, the
   chare objects should move forward with their calculations.  Implement this code
   without using barrier during the actual Jacobi calculation.  Once again, be careful to consider
   all the possible race conditions that might occur and verify that your program is indeed producing
   correct results.
  </p>
