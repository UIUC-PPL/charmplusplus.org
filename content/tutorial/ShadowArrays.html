  <h1>Shadow Arrays (AKA: Bound Arrays)</h1>

  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   It may be useful to have corresponding elements of two or more chare arrays to be located on the
   same processor.  For exmaple, if the corresponding elements of chare arrays <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i>
   frequently communicate with one another, it would be advantagous to have those elements,
   <i>X[i]</i> and <i>Y[i]</i>, on the same processor to reduce communication costs.  Shadow arrays
   in Charm++ are a way of accomplishing just this type of behavior.  When two or more arrays are
   <i>bound</i>, the Charm++ Runtime System ensures that the objects are always located on the same
   physical processor.

  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   Shadow (or bound) arrays create a relationship in terms of element mapping and load balancing between
   two or more arrays.  The idea is fairly straight forward.  First, a chare array is created in the
   standard manner.  Then, a second array is created as a shadow of the first array (or bound to the first
   array).  This is done through the <i>CkArrayOptions</i> parameter to the <i>ckNew</i> call which creates
   the second array.  Additional arrays can also be bound to this set of bound arrays in a similar manner.
  </p>

  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   There is no restriction to the type or number of chare elements in the arrays.  The bound arrays can
   be instances of the same chare array class or be different chare array classes.  Also, the arrays do not
   have to have the same number of elements.  For indexes where the other array doesn't have a corresponding
   element, the element that exists is free to move between processors arbitrarily.  The Charm++ Runtime
   System simply ensures that <i>when there are corresponding elements (that is, elements at
   corresponding indexes), in a set of bound arrays, the elements will be located on the same physical
   processor</i>.
  </p>

  <p class="BasicParagraph">
   Since the corresponding objects are always located on the same processor, the objects can take advantage
   of this in various ways.  For example, they can obtain local pointers to one another via a call to
   <i>ckLocal()</i> on the proxy for the element.  However, each time the objects migrate (i.e. the objects
   are unpacked via the <a href="PackUnPackRoutines.htm">Pack-UnPack Routines</a>), the local pointer needs
   to be refreshed so it is a valid pointer on the new physical processor.
