Profesor P. Geubelle and S. Breitenfeld of the <a href="http://ssm7.ae.uiuc.edu/PHG_GROUP/"> Computational Solid Mechanics Group</a> have developed CrackProp, an explicit Finite Element method simulation of viscoelastic and plasto-elastic mechanics. The simulation tracks conventional volumentric elements, coupled by flat "cohesive" interface elements using the Charm++ <a href="http://charm.cs.uiuc.edu/fem/">Finite Element Framework</a>.

<p>
Professor J. Dantzig and Jun-Ho Jeong of the Solidification Processing Lab have parallelized their dendritic growth metal solidification application using the Charm++ Finite Element Framework. This adaptive mesh, implicit solver fluid dynamics application is quite different from the explicit structures codes normally used. 
</p>
<p>
The framework handles the changes to the adaptive mesh by re-assembling the parallel mesh, repartitioning, and redistributing the mesh pieces. Since the mesh changes only rarely, this does not significantly impact the speed of the simulation. The implicit solvers are implemented using the conjugate gradient method, which solves a global matrix using local operations.

<div id="NAMD"><h2>NAMD - Molecular Dynamics</h2>
<p>
NAMD is a parallel, object-oriented molecular dynamics code designed for high-performance simulation of large biomolecular systems. NAMD is distributed free of charge and includes source code.
Charm++, developed by Prof. Kale and co-workers, simplifies parallel programming and provides automatic load balancing, which was crucial to the performance of NAMD.  It is used by tens of thousands of biophysical researchers with production versions installed on most supercomputing platforms.  See the <a href="http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/namd.html">TCBG NAMD</a> web site for NIH supported download and tutorial instructions.
</p>
<br>
<p>
The dynamic components of NAMD are implemented in the Charm++ parallel language. It is composed of collections of C++ objects, which communicate by remotely invoking methods on other objects. This supports the multi-partition decompositions in NAMD. Also data-driven execution adaptively overlaps communication and computation. Finally, NAMD benefits from Charm++'s load balancing framework to achieve unsurpassed parallel performance.  See <a href="http://charm.cs.uiuc.edu/research/moldyn">PPL NAMD</a> research page for more details.
