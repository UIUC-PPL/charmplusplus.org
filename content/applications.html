<div id="NAMD"><h2>NAMD - Molecular Dynamics</h2>
<p>
NAMD is a parallel, object-oriented molecular dynamics code designed for high-performance simulation of large biomolecular systems. NAMD is distributed free of charge and includes source code.
Charm++, developed by Prof. Kale and co-workers, simplifies parallel programming and provides automatic load balancing, which was crucial to the performance of NAMD.  It is used by tens of thousands of biophysical researchers with production versions installed on most supercomputing platforms.  See the <a href="http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/namd.html">TCBG NAMD</a> web site for NIH supported download and tutorial instructions.

<p>
The dynamic components of NAMD are implemented in the Charm++ parallel language. It is composed of collections of C++ objects, which communicate by remotely invoking methods on other objects. This supports the multi-partition decompositions in NAMD. Also data-driven execution adaptively overlaps communication and computation. Finally, NAMD benefits from Charm++'s load balancing framework to achieve unsurpassed parallel performance.  See <a href="http://charm.cs.uiuc.edu/research/moldyn">PPL NAMD</a> research page for more details.
