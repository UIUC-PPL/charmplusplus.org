<h2>Capabilities</h2>

<h3>Automatic overlap</h3>

<p>Because parallelism in Charm++ is expressed via parallel objects interacting
instead of processors, the runtime can seamlessly provide overlap of
communication and computation as an application runs.</p>

<h3>Automatic load balancing</h3>

<p>Charm++ ships with an entire suite of load balancers, which can be selected
at runtime. All the application must do is provide a hint on when it a good
time to synchronize for load balancing. </p>

<h3>Automatic checkpointing/fault tolerance</h3>

<p>Charm++ can easily checkpoint an application's data to disk or to the memory
of a buddy node. If a fault occurs and the job persists, Charm++ will detect a
hard node failure and automatically continue execution from the previous
in-memory checkpoint. The programmer simply specifies the data to checkpoint
using a simple routine that is used for load balancing to serialize the
data.</p>

<h3>Portable code</h3>

<p>Charm++ comes pre-packaged with many machine layers that are tuned to the
latest supercomputer architectures, ranging from Blue Gene/Q to Cray XK6.</p>

<h3>Independent modules, interleaved execution</h3>

<p>Because Charm++ programs are written in terms of a set of modules that
define parallel objects, multiple modules can execute concurrently. When one
module has little work and is idle, another module can fill the gap. Because
work can be prioritized in Charm++, the user can specify which objects have
priority and they will be treated accordingly by the Charm++ scheduler</p>

<h3>Interoperable with MPI and OpenMP</h3>

<p>When Charm++ is compiled with the MPI machine layer, it can be easily
combined with MPI code to assist porting codes. Charm++ supports time and space
sharing, allowing MPI to execution with Charm++ code in phases or partitioned
by processors.</p>

<h3>Ecosystem of tools</h3>

<p>Charm++ is not just a programming language or runtime; it also comes with a
full suite of tools, ranging from a parallel debugger to performance
visualization. You can even inject python code on the fly as your application
runs using the CCS tool.</p>
