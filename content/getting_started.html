<h2>Getting Started with Charm++</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
    First, get a copy of Charm from the <a href="/download">download page</a>.
    If you want to do development on Charm itself, you may want to clone our
    git repository at <tt>http://charm.cs.illinois.edu/gerrit/charm.git</tt> to make it
    easier to contribute patches and merge your work with the latest version of
    Charm.
    </li>

    <li>
    Next, you need to compile Charm on your system. You'll need basic Unix
    build utilities like make and a C++ compiler. Charm provides a script
    called 'build' in its top-level directory that will build Charm for you,
    given some information about the system you're compiling for and the
    features you want access to. The README file in Charm's top-level directory
    gives details about the various options you have available to you when
    compiling Charm.
    </li>

    <li>
    Now it's time to get started building and running Charm programs. To get
    started, you may want to look at the many examples in the <tt>examples</tt>
    directory of Charm. More information about compiling and running
    applications is available in the <a
        href="http://charm.cs.illinois.edu/manuals/html/install/manual-1p.html">
        installation and usage guide</a>. For more in-depth information about
    the features of Charm, consult the <a
        href="http://charm.cs.illinois.edu/manuals/html/charm++/manual.html">
        Charm++ Parallel Programming System Manual</a>.
