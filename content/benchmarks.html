<div id="hpc"><h2>HPC Challenge</h2>
<p>
Our HPC Challenge suit consists of various benchmarks that demonstrate productivity and performance in a
parallel programming system.
</p>
<br>

<li> <h3>LeandMD</h3>
<p>
LeanMD is a molecular dynamics simulation program written in \charm. This
benchmark simulates the behavior of atoms based on the Lennard-Jones potential,
which is an effective potential that describes the interaction between two
uncharged molecules or atoms. The computation performed in this code mimics the
short-range non-bonded force calculation in NAMD
and resembles the miniMD application in the Mantevo benchmark
suite maintained by Sandia National Laboratories.

<li> <h3>Dense LU</h3>	 	

git://charm.cs.illinois.edu/charmlu.git
<li> <h3>1D FFT	</h3>
<p>
Our implementation of Global FFT takes input size N and performs a complex 1D FFT on an NxN matrix where subsequent rows are contiguous data elements of a double precision complex vector. Three all-to-all transposes are required to perform the FFT and unscramble the data.  All-to-all operations are executed via point-to-point messages and external libraries (FFTW or ESSL) perform serial FFTs on the rows of the matrix.

<li> <h3>Random Access</h3>
<p>
For Random Access benchmark we use the Mesh
Streamer library for optimizing all-to-all
communication on small messages.

<li><h3>Triangular Solver</h3>
<p>
Solution of sparse triangular systems of linear equations
is a performance bottleneck in many methods for solving more general 
sparse systems, such as many iterative methods with preconditioners.
The matrix is divided into blocks of columns. Each block is analyzed to
find its independent rows for computation. If there are dense regions
below the diagonal section (we assume lower triangular for description),
they are divided into new blocks. Each diagonal block starts the computation with
its independent parts and waits for its dependency messages from the left.
Nondiagonal blocks wait for the solution values from their corresponding diagonal block,
and then start their computation (and receipt of other messages).

<li><h3>AMR</h3>
<p>
This benchmarks is mesh restructuring algorithm for adaptive mesh
refinement computations. The parallel mesh restructuring algorithm operates in terms of
near-neighbor communication among individual blocks, and a single
synchronization-only collective.
</p>

git://charm.cs.illinois.edu/benchmarks/amr.git 
<li><h3>Barnes-Hut</h3>
<p>
The Barnes-Hut algorithm is a tree-based scheme to compute fast
and approximate time-series solutions to the N-body problem, where
Barnes-Hut algorithm for N-body problem is a method of calculating forces on a system of N bodies that grows only as N log N. It uses a tree-structured hierarchical recursive subdivision of space into cubic cells. Barnes-Hut method is widely used in cosmological simulations.

<div id="mantevo"><h2>Mantevo</h2>
<p>
Mantevo is a suite of mini-apps, proxy-apps and mini-drivers from Sandia. The
list of mini-apps can be found here. Our leanMD benchmark is a peer of the
miniMD mini-app in the suite.
