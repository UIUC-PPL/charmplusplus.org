<!-- <div id="hpc"><h2>HPC Challenge</h2> -->
<!-- <p> -->
<!-- Our HPC Challenge suit consists of various benchmarks that demonstrate productivity and performance in a -->
<!-- parallel programming system. -->
<!-- </p> -->
<!-- <br> -->

<div class="benchmark">
  <h2>LeandMD</h2>
  <p>LeanMD is a molecular dynamics simulation program written in Charm++. This
    benchmark simulates the behavior of atoms based on the Lennard-Jones
    potential, which is an effective potential that describes the interaction
    between two uncharged molecules or atoms. The computation performed in this
    code mimics the short-range non-bonded force calculation in NAMD and
    resembles the miniMD application in the Mantevo benchmark suite maintained
    by Sandia National Laboratories.</p>

  <h2>Dense LU</h2>

</div>

<div class="benchmark">
  <h2>1D FFT</h2>
  <p> Our implementation of Global FFT takes input size N and performs a
  complex 1D FFT on an NxN matrix where subsequent rows are contiguous data
  elements of a double precision complex vector. Three all-to-all transposes
  are required to perform the FFT and unscramble the data.  All-to-all
  operations are executed via point-to-point messages and external libraries
  (FFTW or ESSL) perform serial FFTs on the rows of the matrix. </p>

<div class="benchmark">
  <h2>Random Access</h2>
  <p> For Random Access benchmark we use the Mesh Streamer library for
    optimizing all-to-all communication on small messages. </p>

<div class="benchmark">
  <h2>Triangular Solver</h2>
  <p> Solution of sparse triangular systems of linear equations is a
    performance bottleneck in many methods for solving more general sparse
    systems, such as many iterative methods with preconditioners.  The matrix
    is divided into blocks of columns. Each block is analyzed to find its
    independent rows for computation. If there are dense regions below the
    diagonal section (we assume lower triangular for description), they are
    divided into new blocks. Each diagonal block starts the computation with
    its independent parts and waits for its dependency messages from the left.
    Nondiagonal blocks wait for the solution values from their corresponding
    diagonal block, and then start their computation (and receipt of other
    messages). </p>

<div class="benchmark">
  <h2>AMR</h2>
  <p> This benchmarks is mesh restructuring algorithm for adaptive mesh
    refinement computations. The parallel mesh restructuring algorithm operates
    in terms of near-neighbor communication among individual blocks, and a
    single synchronization-only collective. </p>

</div>

<div class="benchmark">
  <h2>Barnes-Hut</h2>
  <p> The Barnes-Hut algorithm is a tree-based scheme to compute fast and
    approximate time-series solutions to the N-body problem, where Barnes-Hut
    algorithm for N-body problem is a method of calculating forces on a system
    of N bodies that grows only as N log N. It uses a tree-structured
    hierarchical recursive subdivision of space into cubic cells. Barnes-Hut
    method is widely used in cosmological simulations. </p>
