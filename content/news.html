<h3><a name="SIAM"></a>Local SIAM chapter hosting Charm++ Tutorial</h3>

04/27/2012
<p>
      
On Tuesday, May 1, 2012, the UIUC chapter of SIAM will host a Charm++ tutorial given by PPL'r Phil Miller.  The tutorial will start at 4:00 p.m. in 4403 Siebel Center.  Registration is required. For more information, please visit siam.cs.illinois.edu or register here.



The tutorial will present Charm++, which is a portable  parallel programming system designed with programmer productivity as a major goal. Attendees will become familiar with the asynchronous, object-based programming model of Charm++ and the capabilities its adaptive runtime system offers.



Developed by the Parallel Programming Laboratory over the last 20 years, Charm++ is a portable, mature environment that provides the foundation for several highly scalable and widely used applications in science and engineering, including NAMD, ChaNGa, and OpenAtom. Charm++ runs the same application code on multicore desktops with shared memory, clusters of all sizes, and IBM and Cray supercomputers (such as the upcoming NSF-sponsored Blue Waters), and efficiently supports GPU accelerators where available.



The following week, the Parallel Programming Lab will host its 10th Annual Workshop on Charm++ and its Applications May 7-9 at the Siebel Center, bringing together the Charm++ community and showcasing leading-edge developments in parallel computing.



The target audience for this tutorial is programmers and researchers with any sort of parallel programming experience and basic knowledge of C or C++.
