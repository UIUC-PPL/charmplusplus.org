<h3><a name="charm680"></a>Charm++ Release 6.8.0</h3>
<p>Over 900 commits (bugfixes + improvements + cleanups) have been applied
across the entire system. Major changes are described below:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Charm++ Features</b></li>
		<ol>
			<li>Calls to entry methods taking a single fixed-size parameter can now
  automatically be aggregated and routed through the TRAM library by
  marking them with the [aggregate] attribute.</li>
			<li>Calls to parameter-marshalled entry methods with large array
  arguments can ask for asynchronous zero-copy send behavior with a
  'nocopy' tag in the parameter's declaration.</li>
			<li>The runtime system now integrates an OpenMP runtime library so that
  code using OpenMP parallelism will dispatch work to idle worker
  threads within the Charm++ process.</li>
			<li>Applications can ask the runtime system to perform automatic
  high-level end-of-run performance analysis by linking with the
  '-tracemode perfReport' option.</li>
			<li>Added a new dynamic remapping/load-balancing strategy,
  GreedyRefineLB, that offers high result quality and well bounded
  execution time.</li>
			<li>Improved and expanded topology-aware spanning tree generation
  strategies, including support for runs on a torus with holes, such
  as Blue Waters and other Cray XE/XK systems.</li>
			<li>Charm++ programs can now define their own main() function, rather
  than using a generated implementation from a mainmodule/mainchare
  combination. This extends the existing Charm++/MPI interoperation
  feature.</li>
			<li>Improvements to Sections:</li>
			<ol>
				<li>Array sections API has been simplified, with array sections being
  automatically delegated to CkMulticastMgr (the most efficient implementation
  in Charm++). Changes are reflected in Chapter 14 of the manual.</li>
				<li>Group sections can now be delegated to CkMulticastMgr (improved performance compared to default implementation). Note that they have to be manually delegated. Documentation is in Chapter 14 of Charm++ manual.</li>
				<li>Group section reductions are now supported for delegated sections
  via CkMulticastMgr.</li>
				<li>Improved performance of section creation in CkMulticastMgr.</li>
				<li>CkMulticastMgr uses the improved spanning tree strategies. See above.</li>
			</ol>
			<li>GPU manager now creates one instance per OS process and scales the
  pre-allocated memory pool size according to the GPU memory size and
  number of GPU manager instances on a physical node.</li>
			<li>Several GPU Manager API changes including:</li>
			<ol>
				<li>Replaced references to global variables in the GPU manager API with calls to
  functions.</li>
				<li>The user is no longer required to specify a bufferID in dataInfo struct.</li>
				<li>Replaced calls to kernelSelect with direct invocation of functions passed
  via the work request object (allows CUDA to be built with all programs).</li>
			</ol>
			<li>Added support for malleable jobs that can dynamically shrink and
  expand the set of compute nodes hosting Charm++ processes.</li>
			<li>Greatly expanded and improved reduction operations:</li>
			<ol>
				<li>Added built-in reductions for all logical and bitwise operations
  on integer and boolean input.</li>
				<li>Reductions over groups and chare arrays that apply commutative,
  associative operations (e.g. MIN, MAX, SUM, AND, OR, XOR) are now
  processed in a streaming fashion. This reduces the memory footprint of
  reductions. User-defined reductions can opt into this mode as well.</li>
				<li>Added a new 'Tuple' reducer that allows combining multiple reductions
  of different input data and operations from a common set of source
  objects to a single target callback.</li>
				<li>Added a new 'Summary Statistics' reducer that provides count, mean,
  and standard deviation using a numerically-stable streaming algorithm.</li>
			</ol>
			<li>Added a '++quiet' option to suppress charmrun and charm++ non-error
  messages at startup.</li>
			<li>Calls to chare array element entry methods with the [inline] tag now
  avoid copying their arguments when the called method takes its
  parameters by const&amp;, offering a substantial reduction in overhead in
  those cases.</li>
			<li>Synchronous entry methods that block until completion (marked with
  the [sync] attribute) can now return any type that defines a PUP
  method, rather than only message types.</li>
		</ol>
		<li><b>AMPI Features</b></li>
		<ol>
			<li>More efficient implementations of message matching infrastructure, multiple completion routines, and all varieties of reductions and gathers.</li>
			<li>Support for user-defined non-commutative reductions, MPI_BOTTOM, cancelling receive requests, MPI_THREAD_FUNNELED, PSCW synchronization for RMA, and more.</li>
			<li>Fixes to AMPI's extensions for load balancing and to Isomalloc on SMP builds.</li>
			<li>More robust derived datatype support, optimizations for truly contiguous types.</li>
			<li>ROMIO is now built on AMPI and linked in by ampicc by default.</li>
			<li>A version of HDF5 v1.10.1 that builds and runs on AMPI with virtualization
  is now available at <a href="https://charm.cs.illinois.edu/gerrit/#/admin/projects/hdf5-ampi">https://charm.cs.illinois.edu/gerrit/#/admin/projects/hdf5-ampi</a></li>
			<li>Improved support for performance analysis and visualization with Projections.</li>
		</ol>
		<li><b>Platforms and Portability</b></li>
		<ol>
			<li>The runtime system code now requires compiler support for C++11
  R-value references and move constructors. This is not expected to be
  incompatible with any currently supported compilers.</li>
			<li>The next feature release (anticipated to be 6.9.0 or 7.0) will require
  full C++11 support from the compiler and standard library.</li>
			<li>Added support for IBM POWER8 systems with the PAMI communication API,
  such as development/test platforms for the upcoming Sierra and Summit
  supercomputers at LLNL and ORNL. Contributed by Sameer Kumar of IBM.</li>
			<li>Mac OS (darwin) builds now default to the modern libc++ standard
  library instead of the older libstdc++.</li>
			<li>Blue Gene/Q build targets have been added for the 'bgclang' compiler.</li>
			<li>Charm++ can now be built on Cray's CCE 8.5.4+.</li>
			<li>Charm++ will now build without custom configuration on Arch Linux</li>
			<li>Charmrun can automatically detect rank and node count from
  Slurm/srun environment variables.</li>
		</ol>

<h3><a name="namdhiv"></a>Charm++ application results featured in Nature</h3>
05/30/2013

<p>
NAMD, an application developed using Charm++, was recently used in an all-atom
molecular dynamics simulation to determine the chemical structure of the HIV
Capsid, as reported in a Nature research <a
href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature12162">article</a>.  The simulation
involving about 64 million atoms, was carried out on the Blue Waters system at
the University of Illinois, and benefited from many features and
performance optimizations implemented in Charm++. Results from the simulation
were also featured on the
<a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v497/n7451/index.html">cover</a> of
the magazine. More information about the research and results can be found in
the university
<a href="http://news.illinois.edu/news/13/0529HIVcapsid_KlausSchulten.html">news

<h3><a name="SIAM"></a>Local SIAM chapter hosting Charm++ Tutorial</h3>

04/27/2012
<p>
      
On Tuesday, May 1, 2012, the UIUC chapter of SIAM will host a Charm++ tutorial given by PPL'r Phil Miller.  The tutorial will start at 4:00 p.m. in 4403 Siebel Center.  Registration is required. For more information, please visit siam.cs.illinois.edu or register here.



The tutorial will present Charm++, which is a portable  parallel programming system designed with programmer productivity as a major goal. Attendees will become familiar with the asynchronous, object-based programming model of Charm++ and the capabilities its adaptive runtime system offers.



Developed by the Parallel Programming Laboratory over the last 20 years, Charm++ is a portable, mature environment that provides the foundation for several highly scalable and widely used applications in science and engineering, including NAMD, ChaNGa, and OpenAtom. Charm++ runs the same application code on multicore desktops with shared memory, clusters of all sizes, and IBM and Cray supercomputers (such as the upcoming NSF-sponsored Blue Waters), and efficiently supports GPU accelerators where available.



The following week, the Parallel Programming Lab will host its 10th Annual Workshop on Charm++ and its Applications May 7-9 at the Siebel Center, bringing together the Charm++ community and showcasing leading-edge developments in parallel computing.



The target audience for this tutorial is programmers and researchers with any sort of parallel programming experience and basic knowledge of C or C++.
